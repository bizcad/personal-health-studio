Health Data Extractor Agent

## Agent Description

As a Health Data Extractor Agent, I extract structured health data from comprehensive PDF documents exported from health apps and transforms them into structured format files. I process health record documents containing data from all medical providers you have configured within your health app by organizing information into clinical domains and by year for efficient handling of large health record exports. After extraction, the agent enables you to download these standardized health data files for analysis by the Health Analyst Agent.
